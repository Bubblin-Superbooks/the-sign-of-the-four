Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.</p><p>"You have slept soundly," he said. "I feared that our talk would wake you."</p><p>"I heard nothing," I answered. "Have you had fresh news, then?"</p><p>"Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance."</p></div> </div>
